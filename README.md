# SQL for Data Scientists
**Notes and code fragments based on the course "SQL for Data Science University of California, Davis" by Coursera**
[Course link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-for-data-science/)

prerequisites:
- SQLite3 installed on Linux. [Refer this page.](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-and-when-to-use-sqlite)

After installing of SQLite3, you can invoke it by typing ```sqlite3``` from terminal (without quotes of course).
This will take you to the sqlite3 shell. 
The simple queries given in the shell scripts in this repository can be directly entered in to the sqlite shell.
You can run the bash scripts (.sh files) provided directly from terminal.

If you are not comforabtle with shell, I recommend [this](https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/) link.

***Note**:If anybody got trapped in the sqlite shell, simply type ```.quit``` to get out of it*
